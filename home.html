  List of my favourite qoutes: "Timing is everything. If it's mean to happen, it will, at the right time for the right reasons." <br> <br> “I still find each day too short for all the thoughts I want to think, all the walks I want to take, all the books I want to read, and all the friends I want to see. The longer I live the more my mind dwells upon the beauty and the wonder of the world.”
